#We don't have to read the entire text "text = f.read()""
#we don't need to manually splited since we can loop directly in the file object
f = open('text.txt')
text = f.read()
for line in text.split('\n'):
    print(line)
f.close()


#good way
#loop directly over the file object..you can use it as an ititrate
f = open('text.txt')
for line in f:
    print(line)
f.close()

#even better way
#everything under with are executed in a context 
#allows to do something without having to close and clean up
with open('text.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
